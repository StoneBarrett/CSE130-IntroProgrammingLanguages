firVal = 0

secVal = 0

switch operation

		print firVal + secVal = firVal + secVal
		break
	
	case 2: 
		print Enter the first number
		scan firVal
		print Enter the second number
		scan secVal
		print firVal - secVal = firVal - secVal
		break

	case 3: 
		print Enter the first number
		scan firVal
		print Enter the second number

		print firVal * secVal = firVal * secVal
		break

	case 4: 
		print Enter the first number
		scan firVal
		print Enter the second number
		scan secVal
		print firVal / secVal = firVal / secVal
		break

Notes/Ideas:

\rprint blank for reset to prev line and overwrite
\rprint again to place new text

loop to check for exit or not, reset to menu after calculation

loop to check for primalty
